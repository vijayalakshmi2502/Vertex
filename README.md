Founder-Investor Matching AI Model:--
Overview:--
This project aims to build an AI model that matches founders with investors based on compatibility. The model takes structured startup data and investor preferences as input, processes them using a compatibility scoring system, and ranks investors based on their match score for each founder.

Objective:--
Develop an AI model that: Takes structured startup data and investor preferences as input. Provides a compatibility score between founders and investors. Returns a ranked list of investors for each founder. Dataset:-- Two datasets are used:-- founders.csv: Contains information about startup founders, including industry, stage, funding required, traction, and business model. investors.csv: Contains investor preferences, including preferred industry, investment range, and preferred business model.

Approach:--
Data Loading: Read founders.csv and investors.csv using Pandas. Compatibility Scoring: Compatibility scores are calculated using the following criteria: Industry Match: 30 points Investment Range Match: 30 points (or 10 points for partial match) Business Model Match: 20 points Startup Stage & Traction: 20 points Scores are summed up to generate a total compatibility score between a founder and an investor. Sorting & Ranking: The compatibility scores are sorted for each founder to present the top matches in descending order. Output Generation: The results are saved as ranked_results.csv and displayed for each founder.

Improvements Suggested:--
Integration with Real APIs: Replace simulated scoring with real analysis by integrating the Gemini API or other suitable APIs. Enhanced Scoring Mechanism: Utilize more complex compatibility models (e.g., machine learning-based scoring, cosine similarity). Include additional parameters like location, past investments, and founder reputation. User Interface: Create a FastAPI web application to allow real-time scoring and filtering of results. Scalability: Implement batch processing for large datasets. Store results in a database for further analysis.

How to Run the Code:--
Save the files founders.csv, investors.csv, and matching_model.py in the same directory. Run the script using: The results will be saved as ranked_results.csv.

Requirements:--- Python 3.x pandas numpy requests (If using an API)

Future Work:--
Implement advanced scoring techniques. Build a web-based interface for user interaction. Improve performance and usability.
